**The power is in your hands!**

**Special thanks to Pevenaider for providing us memory addresses and letting us use it in our script.**

This script primarily utilizes the **SendClientCheck** function to scan game memory for third-party modifications such as **S0beit**, **CLEO**, and **MoonLoader**. It is enhanced by Pawn.RakNet and ColAndreas plugins, allowing for precise detections by analyzing server traffic and collision data.

⚠️ Please note: This script is still in development. It's created to work only with open multiplayer. We are constantly working to improve it for the community. If you encounter issues, have feature requests, or want to contribute and showcase your creativity, feel free to reach out—we’d love to hear from you!
