**The power is in your hands!**

**Special thanks to Pevenaider for developing this open-source script and generously sharing it with the open.mp community.**

This script primarily utilizes the **SendClientCheck** function to scan game memory for third-party modifications such as **S0beit**, **CLEO**, and **MoonLoader**. It is enhanced by Pawn.RakNet and ColAndreas plugins, allowing for precise detections by analyzing server traffic and collision data.

⚠️ Please note: This script is still in development. We are constantly working to improve it for the community. If you encounter issues, have feature requests, or want to contribute and showcase your creativity, feel free to reach out—we’d love to hear from you!
