# Antycheat
**Current version: 2.3**

**Special thanks to Pevenaider for creating this open source script and sharing it with the community.**

This script mainly based on Client Check functions. Added ability to work with Pawn.Raknet plugin for better checks at version 2.2. 
* Added some more functions and corrected the whole script for better reading performance.
* Removed unnecessary command based checks.
* Added colandreas dependency for better level checks.
